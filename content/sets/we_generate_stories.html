  <p>This is the first mix I ever released--back in Texas, on August 11, 2002. A couple months earlier, I came out and was thusly dismissed from the church choir director position I'd held for many years. This mix went to a mix-swapping group that branched off a writing community I was a part of at the time. Twenty-two year old me was listening to a lot of electronica, breakbeats, post-rock, and strange textured minimal noise.</p>
  <p>This mix was first in a four-part series: "We generate stories", "for you, because", "you don't save", and "the ones that are yours." Twenty-two year old me also really liked Douglas Coupland references. The other three mixes went to my girlfriend at the time and to one other mix-swapping group.</p>
  <p>Within a few years, all four were lost--until last weekend in Portland, Oregon. A friend of mine found this one in an old CD case, dusted it off, and handed it to me. What you're listening to now is what was on that CD.</p>
  <p>Warning: Beats May Be Broken. May Contain Compression Artifacts. Light Fuse And Point Away From Face.</p>
